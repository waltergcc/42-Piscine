# Rush 00

This is a project that is done in groups. In this project we will create a table where in the 'Main' file will have the number of lines and columns that should be printed.

## Instructions

The rush file that should be delivered is defined by the index of the first letter of the Login of the group leader Modulo by 5.

Example: 

> If the leader's login is 'jklopp'. The first letter is 'j', which is the 10th letter of the alphabet.
Number 10 modulo by 5 is 0. In this case for the jklopp's group, the file to be delivered must be rush00.c.

**NOTE**: The group gets extra points if the other subjects are delivered.

It's necessary to compile the files main.c, ft_putchar.c and rush0X.c together to run. To compile the files directly in terminal, Use the command below:

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c ft_putchar.c rush0X.c -o rush #'x' must be replaced by the rush number
```

## Final grade: Not started :x:
I didn't subscribe to this project during the Piscine period. All exercises were done after the Piscine end to consolidate knowledge. These exercises didn't have the validation of Moulinette.
